# Scripts Folder

This folder contains all terminal commands used to set up the cloud server for my website.

These scripts document:
- VM access (SSH)
- Apache2 installation
- Deployment of HTML files
- SSL and HTTPS setup using Certbot
- Permissions and configurations

Anyone can use these commands to replicate my entire cloud deployment.
